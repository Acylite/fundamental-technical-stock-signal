# fundamental-technical-stock-signal
I hope to ingest Yahoo news articles for sentiment analysis and track recent % changes in top stocks in major industries. The focus is to showcase and practice good data and software architecture pattern. 
I intend to use a local docker app to run the Kafka cluster and possibly ingest such data to BigTable (if we want to store the news article) or BigQuery (if we analyze sentiment during stream).
Hope to use TKinter to have a simple UI that can return the result. 

If the project goes well I can migrate the application to cloud and view the results on an interactive looker dashboard.
